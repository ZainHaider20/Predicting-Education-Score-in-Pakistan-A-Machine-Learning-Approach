Predicting Education Score in Pakistan:
Our project aims to signify the importance of investment in educational infrastructure and studies the link of it with other education metrics in the country. The project uses data for primary and secondary education levels. We hope to contribute to the significant debate on the need for more public investment in the education sector.
The primary aim of the project is to predict the Education Score in Pakistan using machine learning techniques. We aim to test multiple algorithms, treating our target variable as both a continuous (for regression) and categorical (for classification) variable.
